# how-does-renv-work

I always use renv. I don't know how to use renv. Here I figure it out.

Problems:

- [ ] Use renv (properly) with make
- [ ] Use renv with cmdstanr
- [ ] Make renv not complain about R package X in a cloned project
    - [ ] knitr
    - [ ] rmarkdown
    - [ ] yaml


What I'm doing to test

- A mock analysis in `index.qmd`
- Test a cloned project in `tests/`
